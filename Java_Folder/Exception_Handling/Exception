Exception : an exception in java is an event which occurs during the Exception of the program,that disrupts the normal
flow of the program's instructions to overcome this we use Exception handling in java.

Exception handling : 
it is powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be maintained

Types of Java Exceptions : 
1.Checked Exceptions : The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions.
                       For example, IOException, SQLException, etc.Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
2.Unchecked Exceptions : The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions. 
                         For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. 
                         Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.
3.Error : Error is irrecoverable. Some example of errors are OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.

Java Exception KeyWords : 
1.throws : It is used to declare that a method can throw an exception.
2.throw : It is used to throw an exception.
3.try : It is used to catch the exception.
4.catch : It is used to handle the exception.
5.finally : It is used to execute the code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.
